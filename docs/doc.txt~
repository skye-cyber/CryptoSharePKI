ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Your Function:
Loads the server certificate and private key

The server uses its certificate (signed by the intermediate CA) to establish identity.

Loads the intermediate CA certificate

This ensures the server can verify client certificates.

Enforces client certificate authentication (CERT_REQUIRED)

The server rejects clients without valid certificates.

You can take several approaches to trace and debug the certificate verification process:

1. Using OpenSSLâ€™s s_client for Debugging
Running the OpenSSL client with extra debug options can help reveal details during the handshake. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect 192.168.43.233:9001 -state -debug -showcerts
-state and -debug: Print verbose information about the handshake process.

-showcerts: Displays the full certificate chain.

2. Setting an Info Callback in Python
Pythonâ€™s SSLContext allows you to set an info callback to get more detailed information during the handshake. For example:
